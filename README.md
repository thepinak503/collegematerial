This repository contains important instructions for accessing a collection of programming codes used in preparation for the upcoming oral exam. The resource covers various subjects such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming Lab (OOPL)**
- **Computer Graphics Lab (CGL)**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms Lab (DSAL)**
- **Data Structures Lab (DSL)**

> **Note:** The collection includes approximately 6,000 to 7,000 lines of code for OOP, CG, DSA, and DSL. Message Passing (MP) codes are **not included**.

## Instructions

# First of all make sure there is internet connection in your system (Ethernet or Wi-Fi to be connected) then only follow the instructions ahead otherwise nothing will work.

Follow the steps below according to your operating system.

### For Windows

1. **Open the Windows terminal.**
2. Execute the following command:
   ```
   curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/seprog >> pro.txt
   ```
3. After executing the command, open the file `pro.txt` in your favorite text editor to view the programming codes.

### For Linux

1. **Open Terminal.**
2. Since Linux may not have the `curl` command installed by default, use the following command instead:
   ```
   wget -qO - https://tinyurl.com/seprog >> pro.txt
   ```
3. Once the command completes, open `pro.txt` to review the codes.

## Purpose

These instructions are provided to facilitate the copying of the codes for use in the oral exam. Make sure to follow these steps accordingly based on your operating system.
